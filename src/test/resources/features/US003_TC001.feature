  Scenario: Easy links (Shops,Categories, About Us, Contact Us, Become a Professional,Become a User) should be visible and active on the top bar of the site

    Given user launches the browser
    And user goes to the homepage
    And user tests that the search engine is visible
    And user tests that the quick service links on the homepage are visible
    Then user tests that clicking on the quick service links on the homepage takes them to the relevant link
